= Wind Turbines

## Wind Turbine Mechanics
Wind turbines have a area of effect. This means that the power production will decrease per amount of turbines in the area of effect. The area effect allows for a maximum of 4 turbines before it stop producing.

Having 4 turbines in an area will produce the same amount as one turbine.

The area of effect is as follows:

* Mk1 3 foundations.
* Mk2 6 foundations.
* Mk3 10 foundations.
