= Modular Power Generators

## Building Information:
Generators are built on the Converter Platform and can only function if attached to a Turbine.

## Building Cost:
TDB

## RPM Sweetspots:

|===
| Variant | Min | Max

| LV | 2300 | 2600

| MV | 3100 | 3300

| HV | 4000 | 5000
|===


### Efficiency notice:
These machines will not produce specification power if run outside optimal RPM limits, see the above "RPM Sweetspots" table.

For instance, the MV generator will not produce specification power if the RPM exceeds ~3200 or falls below 3100 based on version 2.1.7 hardware. Running a MV generator at 5000 RPM will produce no power at all.


## Variants:
### LV

### MV

### HV
