== Introduction:
Ficsit pioneers can now have refined power production that can provide a variety of power generators either to power your outposts or power your main factories.

== Multiplayer support:

Refined Power has always had multiplayer support as a high priority for any update and this will not change in the slightest. To make sure that playing with your friends is possible and to have a fun experience! While multiplayer support isn't 100% finished yet, we do hope we can fix these little bugs in the future!
